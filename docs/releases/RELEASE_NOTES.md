# Release Notes

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-04

### Summary

- Stabilized release gating with CI workflow coverage for DB generate/migrate/seed, typecheck, build, and API smoke.
- Closed strict browser sign-off to `passed` with explicit citizen I/J/K evidence and Scenario L confirmation.
- Standardized release evidence language (`passed|partial|blocked|not_run`), owner/SLA tracking, and run-log snapshot format.

### Evidence snapshot

- Branch/sync: `master`, `origin/master...master = 0 0`
- Static checks: `db:generate=passed`, `typecheck=passed`, `build=passed`
- API smoke: `passed`
- Browser smoke: `passed`
- CI status: latest run success (`CI / verify`)

### Known platform constraint

- Branch protection API enforcement is blocked by repository plan/public constraints (`403`).
- Until platform capability is upgraded, PR review + CI verification remain process-enforced.

### Risk and rollback

- Risk level: `low`
- Rollback policy: if strict browser Scenario L evidence is missing in a future cycle, revert browser status to `partial` and hold merge decision.

### Release reference

- Release commit: `19c6cc5`
- Tag: `v0.1.0`
